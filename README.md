# DSA-Analysis-and-Design-Portfolio

1- In this course we made a advising assistance software that helped advisors access student course information.
2- To approach this problem I had to figure out the best way to store the information of the courses, in a way that was organized and fast to access.
3- The way I approached most of the roadblocks I encountered was by doing further research online to solve any problem in my code.
4- My work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs by showing me how to choose the correct data structure for my programs.
5- My work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by teaching how to choose the quickest data structures for my programs, while not sacrificing on the features for my program.
